After a long series of procrastination and getting the hit of motivation from reading Atomic Habits(great book which I recommend others) ,I'm finally learning kubernetes basics.As a motivator to get better at writing and publish more posts as well as learn kubernetes.I have decided to publish 1 article every Sunday.I would like to post 2 posts per week but I want to start small and consistent.
