I'm a Software Engineer that loves to learn and create new things which intrigue me.I currently work at Boku(Mumbai,India),holding a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.I currently have worked and experimented in Java,Spring Mvc,Spring Boot,Node js,Mysql,Mongo db and a little bit of React js.

The purpose of this blog here is to share my findings of new tech or what interests me in general and to broaden my knowledge horizon and at the same time express it and share it with others.Its all about becoming better than yesterday,each day at a time.
